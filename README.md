🚀 Beginner OOP Codes
This repository contains Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercises that I worked on while practicing fundamental OOP concepts. These may be basic exercises, but they are greatly contributing to my learning process!

🛠️ What’s in this repository?
✔️ Implementation of classes and objects
✔️ Encapsulation using private attributes and getters/setters
✔️ Inheritance and polymorphism applied to Student and Teacher classes
✔️ List management within a School class to add and remove students and teachers

📌 Overview of the Code
Person Class → Base class with private CPF attribute, getters/setters, and a method to display data.
Student Class → Inherits from Person and includes a grade attribute.
Teacher Class → Inherits from Person and includes a subject attribute.
School Class → Manages lists of students and teachers, allowing additions and removals.

🚀 How to Run the Code

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/beginner-oop-codes.git
cd beginner-oop-codes
Run the file in Node.js
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, execute the JavaScript file:

node filename.js
Or run it in a browser console

Copy and paste the code into the browser's Developer Console (F12 → Console tab).
Press Enter to execute the script.
This repository is a record of my progress in learning and applying OOP concepts. Feel free to explore and provide any feedback!
